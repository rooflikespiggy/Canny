## 1. Project Overview
### Motivation
As university students who are venturing into adulthood, we find ourselves struggling to keep track of our finances. Some find it a hassle to note down every little purchase they make, while others simply donâ€™t find the need to do so. However, it is definitely important for one to keep track of their finances as it is then would we know where your money goes and you can ensure that your money is used wisely.

Many have probably resulted in using money tracking applications on their phones, which are not user friendly, and are hard to use. When in a rush, one would not be in the right frame of mind to slowly navigate their way through the application, just to key in that they spent $3.50 on their chicken rice for lunch. And by the time the day ends, one would simply forget that they had spent that money on lunch. This might not seem to be a problem at the start, but as the amount snowballs, their spending habits are not accurately reflected through the application, thus the application is now purposeless to the user. At the end of the day, the user would simply delete the application.

### Aim
We intend to create an **android application** to allow university students to have a proper budget planning as they venture into adulthood. This enables students to determine in advance whether they will have enough money to do the things they need to do or would like to do in the future.

### User Stories
1. As a student who is entering adulthood, I want to have a targeted monthly spending.
2. As a student who has been worrying about my expenditure, I want to be able to keep track of my daily spendings. 
3. As a student, I tend to spend more on entertainment, I want to allow myself to keep track of my spendings in different categories such as entertainment, transport, food, etc.
4. As a student, I want to know if I still have sufficient budget to spend in that month.
5. As a student, I would like a simplified user interface to keep track of my spendings, but also a detailed report on my spending habits

### Tech Stack
The following technologies will be used in the process of developing the mobile app:
* **Flutter & Dart:** for app development and front-end purposes
