## 1. Project Overview
### Motivation
As university students who are venturing into adulthood, we find ourselves struggling to keep track of our finances. Some find it a hassle to note down every little purchase they make, while others simply donâ€™t find the need to do so. However, it is definitely important for one to keep track of their finances as it is then would we know where your money goes and you can ensure that your money is used wisely.

Many have probably resulted in using money tracking applications on their phones, which are not user friendly, and are hard to use. When in a rush, one would not be in the right frame of mind to slowly navigate their way through the application, just to key in that they spent $3.50 on their chicken rice for lunch. And by the time the day ends, one would simply forget that they had spent that money on lunch. This might not seem to be a problem at the start, but as the amount snowballs, their spending habits are not accurately reflected through the application, thus the application is now purposeless to the user. At the end of the day, the user would simply delete the application.
